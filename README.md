# ExcelUtilityLibrary



This C# library offers a tool to retrieve and store database results into Excel files using the Excel.Interop libraries. Queries can also be stored as text and pipe-delimited files.
Information can also be bulk loaded from Excel Files.

The project is here presented as a Visual Studio 2010 project, where `ExcelUtility.cs` is the main file. Requires the Interop.ADODB library to work
